and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Species-Specific Gender Options** - Genders are now defined per species in setting configurations
  - Added `SpeciesDefinition` dataclass to `src/schemas/settings.py` with `name` and `genders` fields
  - Updated all setting JSON files to use the new species object format
  - Different species can have different genders (e.g., Androids have "None", "Male-presenting", "Female-presenting")
  - Backward compatible: legacy string format still supported
  - Updated wizard template to show species-specific gender options

### Fixed
- **GM Re-Introducing Character Every Turn** - Fixed bug where the Game Master repeated the full character introduction ("You are Durgan Stonehammer...") on every turn instead of only the first. The issue was inconsistent `turn_number` calculation in `game.py`: initial scene used `total_turns + 1` but subsequent turns used just `total_turns` after increment, resulting in both being turn 1. Now both use `total_turns + 1` for consistent numbering.
- **Tool Calling API Error** - Fixed "unexpected tool_use_id in tool_result blocks" error when GM used tools (skill checks, etc.). The assistant message wasn't including `tool_use` content blocks alongside the text, so tool_result messages couldn't find their corresponding tool_use IDs. Now builds proper assistant messages with both text and tool_use blocks.
- **GM Response Lost on Quit** - Fixed issue where quitting (Ctrl+C or /quit) after seeing the GM's response but before full turn processing would lose the response. Now the Turn record is saved and committed immediately after displaying the narrative, ensuring the response is preserved even if subsequent processing is interrupted.
- **Wizard Personality Delegation Not Generating Content** - Fixed bug where LLM would tease generating personality ("I'll craft a nuanced personality...") then ask follow-up questions instead of actually generating it. Updated `wizard_personality.md` template with explicit CRITICAL section showing WRONG vs RIGHT examples for delegation handling. LLM must immediately generate full personality AND output JSON when user says "make it up".
- **Wizard Section Loop After Auto-Fill Confirmation** - Fixed bug where wizard got stuck in a loop after user said "ok" to accept auto-filled values. The LLM kept asking follow-up questions instead of completing the section. Added `pending_confirmation` flag to track when we're waiting for user acceptance after auto-fill, and bypass the LLM when user confirms with acceptance patterns like "ok", "yes", "accept", etc.
- **Wizard Auto-Completing Without Confirmation Prompt** - Fixed bug where personality section auto-completed without showing "Auto-filled: ... Say 'ok' to accept" prompt. The `already_saved` set was calculated AFTER applying field_updates, so new fields were already marked as saved. Moved `already_saved` capture to BEFORE applying updates. Also fixed `{}` appearing in output by removing escaped JSON examples from template.
- **Combined JSON Appearing in Wizard Output** - Fixed bug where combined JSON blocks containing both `field_updates` and `section_complete` were not being stripped from display. Replaced multiple regex patterns with a robust balanced-brace parser in `_strip_json_blocks()` that properly removes any JSON containing wizard-specific keys.
- **Wizard Attributes Section Not Completing** - Fixed bug where attributes section would not output JSON or complete when user said "great", "good", etc. Updated `wizard_attributes.md` template with explicit CRITICAL section showing WRONG vs RIGHT examples. LLM must output field_updates AND section_complete in first response, and immediately complete on acceptance phrases.
- **Wizard Name Section Not Saving Player Values** - Fixed bug where LLM said "I'll update the eye color to hazel" but didn't output JSON, so the field wasn't saved. Updated `wizard_name.md` template with explicit WRONG vs RIGHT examples for when player provides a value directly (like "hazel is cool").
- **Wizard Not Returning to Navigation After Section Completion** - Fixed bug where character creation wizard continued in conversational mode instead of returning to the navigation menu after completing a section (like Species & Gender). The `_parse_wizard_response()` function now handles JSON both with and without markdown code fences, since LLMs sometimes output raw JSON.
- **Prompt Template Leaking into Wizard Display** - Fixed bug where LLM sometimes echoed back parts of the prompt template (e.g., `## Player Input`, `Player: 25`) in its response. Enhanced `_strip_json_blocks()` to strip these template artifacts before display.
- **JSON Output in Wizard Display** - Fixed `section_complete` JSON blocks appearing in character creation wizard output. Added missing regex pattern to `_strip_json_blocks()` function in `src/cli/commands/character.py`.
- **Character Creation Wizard KeyError** - Fixed `KeyError: '"section_complete"'` that occurred when starting a new game. The bug was caused by JSON examples in wizard templates (`data/templates/wizard/*.md`) containing unescaped braces that Python's `str.format()` interpreted as format placeholders. Fixed by escaping braces in all wizard template JSON examples.
- **Background Template KeyError** - Fixed `{name}` placeholder in `wizard_background.md` that caused KeyError during Background section. Changed to `[character]` to avoid Python format string issues.
- **Attributes Template Braces** - Fixed unescaped JSON braces in `wizard_attributes.md` that caused KeyError during Attributes section.
- **Urban Fantasy Spells Showing as Setting** - Moved `urban_fantasy_spells.json` from `data/settings/` to `data/spells/` so it no longer appears as a selectable game setting.
- **Menu "or quit" Display Bug** - Fixed Rich markup in `display.py` where `[q]uit` and `[r]eview` were being interpreted as style tags, showing as "or uit" and "or eview". Escaped brackets with backslash.
- **Game Start EntityAttribute Error** - Fixed `'EntityAttribute' object has no attribute 'current_value'` error when starting game. Changed `attr.current_value` to `attr.value` in `context_compiler.py:342`.
- **LLM Simulating Player Dialogue** - Fixed bug where LLM would generate fake "Player:" dialogue inside its response (e.g., "Player: sounds good", "Player: athletic"). Added regex to `_strip_json_blocks()` to remove all simulated player/assistant dialogue turns.
- **Wizard Field Updates Not Saving** - Strengthened `wizard_name.md` template with explicit FORBIDDEN section and WRONG/RIGHT examples to ensure LLM includes all discussed fields in the JSON output, not just narrative text.
- **Wizard Auto-Completing Without Confirmation** - Fixed bug where wizard could mark sections complete while silently filling in values the user never confirmed. Added validation in `character.py` to detect when `section_data` introduces new required values, showing "Auto-filled: field=value" and requiring explicit confirmation before proceeding.
- **Hidden Backstory Leaking to Player** - CRITICAL fix for wizard revealing GM-only secrets in visible text (e.g., "Hidden Backstory Element: Unknown to Calum..."). Updated `wizard_background.md` with explicit FORBIDDEN section and added safety net regex in `_strip_json_blocks()` to strip any "Hidden Backstory:", "Secret:", "GM Note:", or "Unknown to X," patterns that leak into narrative.

  - `SLOT_COVERS` system - full_body covers torso and legs
  - `ItemManager.get_available_slots()` - Returns base + bonus slots for entity
  - `ItemManager.get_outfit_by_slot()` - Groups equipped items by slot

  - `ItemManager.format_outfit_description()` - Human-readable outfit for GM context
  - Updated `ItemManager.update_visibility()` with covering system
- **Outfit CLI command** - `rpg character outfit` shows layered clothing
  - Groups items by body slot with layer display
  - Shows hidden items (dimmed) vs visible items
  - Displays bonus slots provided by items
  - Visible items summary at bottom
- **Updated setting JSON files** with new equipment slots
  - All settings now have 26+ base slots
  - Added `bonus_slots` section for dynamic slots
  - Starting equipment uses new slots (feet_shoes, belt pouches, etc.)
  - Items can now have `provides_slots` array

### Changed
- Game loop uses `progress_spinner` instead of `console.status()`
- `display_character_status()` now uses Rich Table instead of Panel

### Fixed
- **AI character creation JSON hidden from users** - JSON blocks no longer shown in dialogue
  - Added `_strip_json_blocks()` function to remove `suggested_attributes` and `character_complete` JSON
  - Users now see clean conversational text without machine-readable markup
- **AI character creation preserves mystery** - No more spoilers about hidden character aspects
  - Added "Character Creation Philosophy" section to template
  - AI only reveals what the character knows about themselves
  - Secret backstory elements (hidden powers, mysterious origins) are created but never mentioned
- **AI character creation asks for confirmation** - Final check before completing
  - Added "Before Completing Character" section to template
  - AI now asks "Is there anything else you'd like to add or change?" before finishing
  - Gives players a chance to tweak details before committing
- **AI character creation "surprise me" behavior** - AI now respects user delegation phrases
  - Added "Detecting User Delegation" section to `character_creator.md` template
  - Handles full delegation ("surprise me", "it's up to you", "dealer's choice")
  - Handles partial delegation ("I like Eldrin, you decide the rest")
  - AI now generates complete character immediately instead of asking more questions
- **Play without character prompts for creation** - `rpg play` no longer silently creates empty character
  - Now prompts "Create a character now? (y/n)" when no character exists
  - If yes, launches AI-assisted character creation
  - If no, exits with helpful message to use `rpg character create`
  - Removed `_get_or_create_player` in favor of `_get_player` (no silent creation)
- **Async AI character creation** - `_ai_character_creation()` now properly awaits async LLM calls
  - Added wrapper function with `asyncio.run()` to call async `_ai_character_creation_async()`
- **Invalid model name** - Fixed `cheap_model` from `claude-haiku-3` to `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`
- **SQLite foreign key enforcement** - `get_db_session()` now enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`
- **Character status command** - Fixed iteration over `player.attributes` relationship
  - Was calling `.items()` on SQLAlchemy relationship list, now iterates properly
- **NeedsManager method name** - Fixed `get_needs_state()` to `get_needs()` in status command
- `is_equipped` bug in character.py - was referencing non-existent field
  - Now correctly uses `body_slot is not None` to check equipped status
  - Fixed both inventory and equipment commands

### Also Changed
- Updated `docs/implementation-plan.md` to reflect actual implementation status
- Updated test count in CLAUDE.md (1121 tests, not 500)
- Extended `SettingSchema` with `description`, `equipment_slots`, and `starting_equipment` fields
- Extended `AttributeDefinition` with `description` field
