# Millbrook Region - Finn's Journey World Data
# Zone and location definitions for the medieval fantasy setting

name: Millbrook Region
description: |
  A modest farming village of two hundred souls, Millbrook sits at the crossroads
  where the East Road meets the South Road to Thornbury. The village takes its name
  from the old mill that once ground grain beside the river, though the wheel has
  stood silent for a generation. Strange signs have appeared lately - livestock
  marked at birth, nightmares plaguing the villagers, and an unseasonable cold
  drifting from the distant Hollow Mountains.

  - location_key: market_square
    display_name: Market Square
    zone_key: millbrook_village
    category: outdoor
    visibility: landmark
    description: |
      The heart of Millbrook opens before you - a cobblestone square worn smooth
      by generations of feet and cart wheels. A massive old oak dominates the
      western edge, its branches spreading shade over weathered wooden benches
      where elders gather to gossip.

      At the square's center stands the village well, its stone rim darkened with
      age and carved with symbols that most villagers dismiss as "old decoration."
      The well's wooden cover is secured with an iron lock that no one remembers
      the key to.

      Market stalls line the eastern edge on trading days. The Dusty Flagon's
      painted sign creaks above its door to the south, while the Chapel of Light's
      modest steeple rises to the southeast.
    atmosphere: |
      Morning: Merchants setting up stalls, the smell of fresh bread, dogs chasing
      children between the stalls.
      Afternoon: Peak bustle of trading, the clink of coins, heated haggling.
      Evening: Quiet settling over empty stalls, long shadows from the chapel
      steeple, the first stars appearing.
    typical_crowd: |
      Farmers, their families, traveling merchants on market days. Occasional
      travelers passing through on the roads.

  - location_key: village_well
    display_name: The Old Well
    zone_key: millbrook_village
    category: landmark
    visibility: landmark
    description: |
      The ancient well rises waist-high from the cobblestones, its circular stone
      rim worn into gentle curves by countless hands. Strange symbols are carved
      into the weathered stone - spirals and stars that catch the light oddly at
      dawn and dusk. A heavy oak cover, bound in iron and secured with a rusted
      lock, seals the well shut.

      Villagers will tell you the well went dry fifty years ago, that the lock is
      just to keep children from falling in. But on quiet nights, some swear
      they've heard sounds from below - like distant chanting, or perhaps just
      the wind playing tricks in the old stones.
    atmosphere: |
      There's something about standing near the well that makes the hairs on your
      neck prickle. The symbols seem to shimmer at the edge of vision, and the
      air feels cooler here, even in high summer.
    typical_crowd: |
      Villagers collecting water from the newer pump by the oak. Children daring
      each other to touch the old symbols.

    category: building
    visibility: landmark
    description: |
      A two-story building of weathered timber and whitewashed daub, the Dusty
      Flagon leans slightly to the left as if tired from decades of serving the
      village. A painted sign depicting a foam-topped tankard swings above the
      door, its colors faded but the image still clear.

      Warm light spills through diamond-paned windows, and even from outside you
      can hear the murmur of conversation, the clink of tankards, and occasionally
      the wavering voice of Old Aldric spinning one of his tales.
    atmosphere: |
      The smell of wood smoke, spilled ale, and meat pies greets you at the
      threshold. Inside, the common room is warm and close, the low ceiling dark
      with generations of hearth smoke.
    typical_crowd: |
      Farmers seeking a drink after the day's work, travelers resting before
      continuing their journey.

    zone_key: millbrook_village
    category: room
    visibility: visible_from_zone
    description: |
      Low-beamed and smoky, the common room wraps around a massive stone fireplace
      that dominates the far wall. Mismatched tables and chairs fill the space,
      their wood dark and scarred from years of use. A long bar of polished oak
      runs along the right wall, behind which Tom keeps his barrels and bottles
      in neat rows.

      A corner near the fireplace has been claimed by Old Aldric for as long as
      anyone remembers - his chair is the only matching piece of furniture in the
      room, brought from his own home years ago. The locals call it "Aldric's
      Throne."

      Hunting trophies hang on the walls between oil lamps: a boar's head, a wolf
      pelt gone moth-eaten, and mysteriously, a shield bearing a star-and-spiral
      design that no one can explain but Tom refuses to take down.
    atmosphere: |
      Evening: Voices rising and falling in familiar rhythms, Old Aldric's corner
      drawing those who want a story, serious drinkers at the bar.
      Afternoon: Near-empty except for Tom polishing glasses and perhaps one or
      two travelers resting.
    typical_crowd: |
      Farmers, field hands, the occasional merchant. Widow Brennan comes in on
      Sundays after chapel.

    description: |
      A small room above the common area, available for rent to travelers. A
      narrow bed, a washstand, and a small window overlooking the market square.
      The floorboards creak with every step, and sounds from below filter up
      through the gaps.
    atmosphere: |
      Simple but clean. The smell of dried lavender from a bundle hung by the
      window. Occasional laughter from below.
    typical_crowd: |
      Travelers, merchants like Master Corin when he passes through.

  - location_key: chapel_of_light
    display_name: Chapel of the Light
    zone_key: millbrook_village
    category: building
    visibility: landmark
    description: |
      A modest stone chapel rises from the southeast corner of the square, its
      single steeple pointing toward heaven like a finger raised in gentle
      admonishment. The building is old - far older than most structures in
      Millbrook - its stones fitted without mortar in a style that predates the
      current faith.

      Villagers say the chapel was built over an older shrine, though the priests
      who came generations ago consecrated it to the Light and called it holy.
      Sister Maren tends it now, the only ordained servant of the faith for
      twenty miles.
    atmosphere: |
      Cool and quiet, the chapel smells of candle wax and dried flowers. Dust
      motes drift in the colored light from the windows. There's a sense of
      peace here, though also something watchful.
    typical_crowd: |
      Villagers seeking prayer or counsel. Fuller on Sundays.

    description: |
      Wooden pews face a simple altar of white stone, upon which a golden sunburst
      symbol catches the light from the stained windows. Candles burn in iron
      sconces along the walls, their flames steady despite occasional drafts from
      the old stones.

      The floor is made of large flagstones, some carved with words worn to
      illegibility by centuries of feet. One stone near the altar is slightly
      different from the others - darker, with a faint pattern that might be a
      constellation if you knew to look for it.
    atmosphere: |
      Reverent silence fills the space. The colored light shifts throughout the
      day, casting moving patterns across the pews. Whispers seem to carry
      strangely here, sometimes echoing when they shouldn't.
    typical_crowd: |
      Those seeking prayer, Sister Maren conducting services.

    description: |
      A small room lined with shelves bearing bound ledgers, scrolls, and books
      accumulated over the chapel's long history. Sister Maren's writing desk
      sits beneath a narrow window, perpetually covered in correspondence and
      notes.

      Most of the collection consists of mundane records - births, deaths,
      marriages, tithes. But the oldest shelf, high on the back wall and requiring
      a ladder to reach, holds books that predate the current faith. Their spines
      bear no titles, only embossed symbols of stars and spirals.
    atmosphere: |
      Dust and old paper. The scratch of quill on parchment. Afternoon light
      filtering through a window that hasn't been cleaned in Sister Maren's
      memory.
    typical_crowd: |
      Sister Maren at her research. Rare visitors with her permission.

    description: |
      Heat washes over you from the open-fronted smithy where Henrik plies his
      trade. The forge glows orange-red in its brick housing, bellows wheezing
      as an apprentice works them. Sparks fly as hammer meets metal, the rhythm
      as regular as a heartbeat.

      Tools hang in precise rows along the walls - tongs, hammers, files, chisels.
      Finished work waits on racks: horseshoes, nails, door hinges, the occasional
      knife or farm implement. A hand-painted sign above the entrance reads
      "HONEST WORK, FAIR PRICES."
    atmosphere: |
      The clang of hammer on anvil, the hiss of hot metal quenched in water, the
      rumble of the forge fire. The air shimmers with heat. Henrik's voice, gruff
      but not unkind, calling instructions to his apprentice.
    typical_crowd: |
      Farmers needing repairs, merchants seeking horseshoes, travelers with broken
      wagon fittings.

  - location_key: old_mill
    display_name: The Old Mill
    zone_key: millbrook_village
    category: building
    visibility: visible_from_zone
    description: |
      The mill stands at the village's eastern edge where a stream once ran strong
      enough to turn its wheel. The wheel itself has rotted through, wooden spokes
      collapsed into the dry streambed like broken fingers. No one has worked here
      in fifty years.

      The building's stone foundation remains solid, but the timber upper floors
      have surrendered to weather and neglect. Gaps show in the roof where shingles
      have blown away. The door hangs crooked on rusted hinges, creaking in the
      wind.

      Village children dare each other to enter. Most refuse. Those who do speak
      of strange sounds - grinding stone when no stones move, whispered voices,
      cold spots that raise gooseflesh even in summer.
    atmosphere: |
      The smell of rot and damp stone. Shadows deeper than they should be. The
      constant creak of old timbers settling. A feeling of being watched from
      the dark corners.
    typical_crowd: |
      Abandoned. Occasionally brave children or curious strangers.

  - location_key: sealed_shrine
    display_name: The Sealed Shrine
    zone_key: millbrook_village
    category: underground
    visibility: hidden
    description: |
      A spiraling stone staircase descends into darkness, each step carved with
      the same star-spiral symbols from the well above. The air grows cold as
      you descend, carrying the scent of ancient stone and something else -
      ozone, like the air before a lightning strike.

      The stairs open into a circular chamber perhaps thirty feet across. The
      walls are covered in faded murals depicting robed figures raising their
      hands toward a sky full of stars, driving back writhing shapes of pure
      darkness. An altar of black stone stands at the chamber's center, its
      surface etched with a constellation pattern that seems to shift when
      viewed directly.

      Behind the altar, a portion of the wall has collapsed, revealing rough-hewn
      tunnels that descend further into the earth. Cold air rises from below,
      carrying with it a sound like distant breathing.
    atmosphere: |
      The silence here is absolute - sound seems muffled, absorbed by the ancient
      stones. Torchlight wavers despite no breeze. The constellation on the altar
      glows faintly in the darkness, a pale blue luminescence that casts no
      shadows.
    typical_crowd: |
      None. Hidden and sealed for generations.

    description: |
      Two miles west of Millbrook along a rutted dirt track, Brennan Farm spreads
      across a gentle hillside. The farmhouse is modest but well-maintained, its
      whitewashed walls bright against the green of surrounding pastures. A
      weathered red barn stands nearby, home to two draft horses, a milk cow,
      and a flock of chickens that seem to rule the farmyard.

      This is where Finn grew up, where Widow Brennan took him in as an infant
      when his mother died. A small garden plot behind the house holds vegetables
      and herbs. Hidden among the herbs, marked by a flat stone, is where Finn's
      mother was buried - unmarked save for the stone, as she requested.
    atmosphere: |
      The smell of hay and animals, the distant lowing of the cow, chickens
      squawking at perceived threats. Peace here, but also hard work - the kind
      of honest labor that builds strong backs and simple dreams.
    typical_crowd: |
      Just Widow Brennan and Finn. Occasionally neighboring farmers helping with
      harvest or Finn helping them in return.

    category: ruins
    visibility: landmark
    description: |
      Rising from a hilltop a mile north of Millbrook, the ruined tower stands
      like a broken tooth against the sky. Once it must have been impressive -
      five stories of fitted stone with windows facing every direction. Now only
      two stories remain, the upper floors collapsed into a jumble of masonry
      within the shell.

      Villagers call it the "Watcher's Tower" without knowing why. Children play
      here sometimes during the day, though none stay past sunset. The stones
      bear the same spiral-star carvings found on the village well, though these
      are larger, more elaborate, and include words in a language no one in
      Millbrook can read.

      The foundation is solid, and someone has cleared the rubble from the ground
      floor, leaving a circular chamber with a fire pit at its center and signs
      of recent habitation.
    atmosphere: |
      Wind whistling through broken stones, the cry of ravens nesting in the upper
      ruins. By day, an eerie beauty - the view from here extends for miles. By
      night, an oppressive darkness that lanterns seem to barely penetrate.
    typical_crowd: |
      Children during the day. The Hermit visits during new moons.

      Greywood proper. A worn trail leads into the shadows, marked by stones that
      hunters have placed over generations.
    atmosphere: |
      Birdsong fading as you approach the treeline. The temperature drops
      noticeably under the canopy. The smell of leaf mold and living green.

    visibility: hidden
    description: |
      The forest parts reluctantly here, forming a rough circle perhaps fifty
      paces across. A tumbledown cottage stands at its center, walls patched with
      moss and roof half-covered in living sod. Smoke rises from a crooked chimney.

      A vegetable garden struggles against the forest's encroachment on one side,
      while the other holds a well-stocked woodpile and a rack for drying herbs
      and mushrooms. The clearing feels protected somehow, quieter than the
      surrounding woods - the birdsong here is sweeter, the light gentler.

      An old man lives here, they say. He was here before anyone remembers, and
      he keeps to himself. He has no name that Millbrook knows. They just call
      him the Hermit.
    atmosphere: |
      Peace, but also watchfulness. The clearing feels like a held breath, like
      sanctuary that knows it's temporary. The herbs drying on the rack have an
      unfamiliar fragrance - clean and sharp, like starlight given scent.
    typical_crowd: |
      The Hermit alone. Rare visitors who manage to find the place.

    description: |
      The forest gives way to shaped stone so gradually you almost miss the
      transition. What seemed like a mossy hillside becomes a wall, what looked
      like a fallen tree is a collapsed column, and before you stands a doorway
      carved from living rock.

      The temple is half-swallowed by the forest, its domed roof broken open to
      admit a shaft of light that falls precisely on the altar at the chamber's
      heart. The walls bear faded paintings of robed figures with stars in their
      eyes, their hands raised to seal a howling darkness into mountain peaks.

      This was a place of the Starbound Order, perhaps their most sacred site in
      this region. The altar holds a shallow depression sized to hold a medallion.
    atmosphere: |
      Profound silence. Light that moves in ways it shouldn't. A sense of
      presence, not threatening but immense - like standing in the shadow of
      something vast that has turned to notice you.
    typical_crowd: |
      None. Lost and forgotten until rediscovered.

    description: |
      The Moss River winds through the farmland southeast of Millbrook, a lazy
      waterway that provides irrigation for the fields and fish for village
      tables. Willows trail their branches in the current, and flat stones along
      the bank make good spots for fishing or washing clothes.

      Lately, the river has grown strange. Fish are caught with marks on their
      scales - circular patterns, like brands. The water runs colder than it
      should for the season. Fishermen report their lines being cut from below,
      or snagging on things that move against the current.
    atmosphere: |
      The burble of water over stones, the buzz of insects, the splash of fish
      jumping. Peaceful, but with an undertone of wrongness lately - the water
      is too cold, the fish too scarce.
    typical_crowd: |
      Fishermen, women doing laundry, children playing on hot days.

      The East Road runs straight as an arrow through the farmlands, connecting
      Millbrook to the market town of Harwick two days' travel distant. It's a
      proper road, paved with fitted stones that the old Empire laid down
      centuries ago, though weeds grow through the cracks now.

      Travelers are common here - merchants with their wagons, farmers taking
      goods to market, occasionally soldiers or messengers on official business.
      Roadside shrines to the Light mark each mile, most tended, some overgrown.
    atmosphere: |
      The clatter of cart wheels, the call of merchants, dust rising in dry
      weather. A sense of connection to the wider world.
    typical_crowd: |
      Merchants, farmers, travelers, occasional patrols.

      Less traveled than the East Road, the South Road winds through increasingly
      hilly terrain toward Thornbury, a mining settlement a day's journey south.
      The road is rougher here, more dirt track than paved way, and bandits have
      been known to lurk in the rocky passes.

      The hills grow higher as you travel south, eventually rising into the
      foothills of the Hollow Mountains - visible on clear days as purple shadows
      on the horizon.
    atmosphere: |
      Quieter than the East Road. The wind carries a chill from the mountains.
      Rocky outcrops provide cover for ambush.
    typical_crowd: |
      Miners, ore wagons, the occasional brave traveler.
