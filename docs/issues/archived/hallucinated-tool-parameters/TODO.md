# TODO: Hallucinated Tool Parameters

## Investigation Phase
- [x] Reproduce the issue (Session 293, Turn 13)
- [x] Identify affected code paths (tool execution)
- [x] Document current behavior (params ignored gracefully)
- [x] Find root cause (schema confusion)

## Design Phase
- [x] Propose solution (accept, improve docs, or add feedback)
- [x] Identify files to modify
- [x] Define test cases
- [x] Review with user - decided "Won't Fix"

## Implementation Phase
- [x] No changes needed - current handling is sufficient

## Verification Phase
- [x] Graceful handling already verified by existing tests
- [x] Valid params work correctly (test coverage exists)

## Completion
- [x] Update README.md status to "Won't Fix"
- [x] No commit needed (no code changes)
